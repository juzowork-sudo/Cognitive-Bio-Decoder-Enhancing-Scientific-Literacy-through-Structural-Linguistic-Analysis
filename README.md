# Cognitive Bio-Decoder (BioRoot) 🧬

**Applied Science Project | Infomatrix Asia 2026**

> Transforming passive memorization into active understanding through AI and Structural Linguistics.

---

## 📖 Overview
**Cognitive Bio-Decoder** addresses the "terminological barrier" in biology. Mastery of this science requires understanding thousands of terms rooted in Latin and Greek. Traditional rote learning often fails due to the lack of systematic review and structural understanding.

Our solution, **BioRoot**, is an intelligent platform that deconstructs complex scientific terms in real-time and optimizes memory retention using cognitive psychology.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **AI-Driven Morphemic Analysis:** Powered by **Google Gemini API**, the bot performs real-time structural-linguistic analysis, breaking terms into prefix, root, and suffix.
- **Cognitive Optimization:** Implements a Spaced Repetition System based on the **Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve** to ensure long-term knowledge retention.
- **Smart Learning Logic:** The algorithm calculates the optimal review time for each user, preventing memory decay.
- **Accessibility:** Available 24/7 as a Telegram-based digital tutor.

## 🧬 The Science Behind It
We use a mathematical model to track memory retention:
$$b = \frac{100k}{(\log(t))^c + k}$$
*Where **b** is the percentage of retained information, and **t** is time.*

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.10+
- **Framework:** `Aiogram 3.x` (Asynchronous Telegram Bot API)
- **AI Engine:** `Google Generative AI` (Gemini Pro)
- **Database:** JSON-based persistent storage
